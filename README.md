# Overview
This repository is a code sample for an application for the Tobin Center/Economics
Pre-Doctoral Fellows Program at Yale University, applied 2025. It contains the majority of
the code for a research project extending the analysis of a paper by Nathaniel Baum-Snow 
titled ["Did Highways Cause Suburbanization?"](

Analysis was performed in Stata, with Excel used for source data cleaning.

## msa_list
The focus of this directory is a dataset by the same name. It adds race and industry share 
variables for applicable MSAs/central cities. Child directories contain source data,
conversion and cleaning scripts, and cleaned data for these variables and other relevant 
information.

## table4e
This directory contains files for creating Table 4e, and extension for Table 4 in the
original paper, adding new regressions. The directory also contains a directory used for the
analysis done for a term paper based on this project. It was nested for testing and
reference throughout the duration of the project.
